## Instructions on running those py files and tests

Please make sure to add those py files in the places that they are originally put in the starter repo to make sure everything runs smoothly.

## Instructions on running CS189_HW6_NN.ipynb

Please run all cells strictly from top to bottom to avoid potential errors. All code chunks are clearly labeled. Therefore, if you want to take a look at the code for specific questions, you can just navigate to the question labels. For example, if you want to look at the code for Task 7.1, just look up for the task name: MLP for Fashion Mnist in CS189_HW6_NN.ipynb and take a look at the code below it.
